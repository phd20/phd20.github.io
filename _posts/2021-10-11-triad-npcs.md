# Triad NPCs

Creating interesting NPCs is challenging for new Dungeon Masters. But it doesn't have to be. Let's take a look at three methods for creating interesting NPCs with ease.

## Character Archetypes

The simplest way to create an interesting NPC is to borrow or steal one from the media you consume. This method is popular because its effective and easy. Michael Shea even details it further in [Return of the Lazy Dungeon Master](https://slyflourish.com/returnofthelazydm/). Think of an interesting character from any book, movie, TV series, etc. That character is now the foundation of your NPC. You can use their voice, personality, and motivations.

Not as much as you might think. Your NPC likely has a different name. Your attempt at the character's voice will be unique. Unless you're **really** good at impressions, no one will know the difference. But to make your NPC even more unique, keep reading.

## Fusing Character Archetypes

To make your NPC more interesting, add another archetype. Take two interesting characters from any book, movie, TV series, etc. Take the voice of one but the personality of the other. Use the motivations of one but the flaws of the other. Let's look at an example.

I need a tavern keeper NPC. I'll use Oprah and Ash Ketchum as inspiration. For Oprah, let's stick with the "You get a car! And you get a car! Everyone gets a car!" meme thing. For Ash, let's have the bartender be collecting rare ales. And he's really annoying about it.

Javed Highburrow runs a respected establishment near the city gates. Everyone who is anyone drinks here. He's been known to buy drinks for everyone, frantically waving his hands and shouting, "You get a drink. And you get a drink! Everyone gets a drink!" But few can stand a conversation with Javed. He's obsessed with collecting all 150 rare ales from the region and he won't shut up about becoming "the very best" ale master.

With a simple fusing of two character archetypes (or real people), we've created an interesting NPC with little effort. But we can take things one step further for the best NPCs yet.
