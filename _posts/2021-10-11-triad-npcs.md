## Triad NPCs

Creating interesting NPCs is challenging for new Dungeon Masters. But it doesn't have to be. Let's take a look at three methods for creating interesting NPCs with ease.

Think of an interesting character from any book, movie, TV series, etc. That character is now the foundation of your NPC. You can use their voice, personality, and motivations.
