You have good ideas. You have *great* ideas. Just not when you need them. 

If you're anything like me, you're inspired by all kinds of things from the world around you. But you grasp at straws when writing an adventure or building a world. I use a **brainstorm document** to solve this problem. This gives me a system for capturing, generating, and using ideas. The key is keeping it simple and accessible.

## Capture Ideas

Think of it as a *bag of holding* for my ideas. Any time inspiration strikes, I add a quick note to the brainstorm doc. A quick glance at my document would reveal things like:

- Concepts from other creators
- Worldbuilding ideas
- Story ideas
- Cool names
- Cool phrases
- Words I like
- Images or pictures
- Ideas for mechanics

If I'm reading a book and something stands out, I drop a quick note on my document. Same with movies, television, and just browsing the hellscape that is the internet in 2022. 

Capture. It. All. Nothing is too much.

### Keeping It Simple

A **simple** brainstorm document will allows me to focus on the ideas. I need a place to write down words or drop in pictures. Not much else. Bells and whistles are fun until they interfere with the process itself.

As for the structure of the notes, there isn't one. It's a running list of randomness. And I think that's key. I could organize it into categories like *names*, *mechanics*, *places*, etc. But that would add time and complexity to capturing ideas. I would have to figure out where to put it and find that section of the document. Not only that, I'd be limiting myself by labeling ideas before they're used. Best to let them exist as chaos to extract inspiration from later.

### Keeping It Accessible

Inspiration and ideas strike like lightning—fast and unpredictable in their timing. An **accessible** brainstorm document ensures that I am ready for it. For example, a whiteboard in my office wall isn't very accessible when I'm at the bookstore. Neither is a Microsoft Word document.

For most of us, our phones are accessible. I use the standard Notes app. But any simple note-taking app will suffice. As would a pocket notebook and pen. And you'd look much more sophisticated than I do with my phone.

## Generate Ideas

Now for the magic. When I go to write an adventure or build a world, I open the document. I'm immediately flooded with things that previously inspired me—ideas and names ready for use. I might grab a cool name from my list for a faction that I'm building. Or I might just use inspiration from the document to come up with something entirely new. But it never fails. The document gets the creative engine going each and every time.

Take what you will from this but know that few tools have been as powerful as a good system for capturing ideas. And it's easy to start today.

## Excerpts From My Brainstorm Document
*Here are some examples from my brainstorming document with brief explanations about why they're there.*

**Something with a word like “Krypton”.** I just really think Krypton is a cool word.

**Drel-Krafal.** Another cool name.

**"Know that this is what awaits you on our shores."** A fun quote. Maybe a threat? 

**Elves more like Jak and less like humans.** Yes, that's referring to Jak from Jak and Daxter.

**Great Horned Owls are sacred and good luck.** Duh, cuz why not.

**Burning prayers (write out and burn) or burying bones pleases the gods.** A little Runescape inspiration.

**Inland sea.** I really wanted a location with an inland sea.

**100 “Skyrim” Tomes.** I've long adored how you can learn the lore of Skyrim from the books you randomly find all over.
