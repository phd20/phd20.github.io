I've self-published products across various platforms for 5E. I've learned a lot and I want to share that. Maybe you can use what I've learned and maybe not. At the very least, I hope it's interesting and gets you thinking.

## What You Need To Know First
Unless asked, I try to steer clear of advice. So what follows are my observations. To make those meaningful, you need to know a little bit about me and my current situation. 

- I do this for fun. It's a hobby and I'm not trying to make a living off of it. 
- I have a small social media presence. 500+ followers on Twitter. That's it.
- I don't spend money on advertising and my marketing strategy is unsophisticated (if not non-existent).
- I have a dozen email newsletter subscribers. This is new and I didn't have it for most of the products I'll be talking about.

Why am I writing this as a small, hobby publisher with very little reach? Because I think that's the situation for the majority of creators. If I can provide any insights, I want to.

## The Numbers
I like raw data. So here it is. All products have been published for right around a year or less. Anything marked with an * is the *suggested* price for a **Pay What You Want** title.

| Product                      | Type         | Price  | Units Sold | Net    | Royalties | Platform   |
| ---------------------------- | ------------ | ------ | ---------- | ------ | --------- | ---------- |
| Infinite Menu                | Random Table | $0.99* | 529        | $21.48 | $10.87    | DM's Guild |
| Doom on Starspell Mountain   | Adventure    | $3.99* | 337        | $58.56 | $29.35    | DM's Guild |
| Physician Background         | Background   | $0.99* | 191        | $6.90  | $3.48     | DM's Guild |
| Freeblood 7's                | Mini-game    | $4.99* | 156        | $7.08  | $1.78     | DM's Guild |
| Astronomer Background        | Background   | $0.99* | 156        | $3.49  | $1.76     | DM's Guild |
| Narrative Wealth             | Sub-system   | $2.50  | 4          | $10.00 | $7.16     | Ko-Fi      |
| Woodland Tavern Map          | Stock Map    | $1.99  | 3          | $5.97  | $3.00     | DM's Guild |
| Brewery/Roastery Fantasy Map | Stock Map    | $2.99  | 2          | $2.99  | $1.50     | DM's Guild |
| Court of the Gem Dragon Map  | Stock Map    | $2.99  | 2          | $2.99  | $1.50     | DM's Guild |

## Observations

### Platform
In my experience as a smaller creator, products get more traffic on the DM's Guild. "But, Kirk, you only have one product on another platform!" Not quite. I only have *sales* for one product on another platform. I have 11 products on Ko-Fi, 9 on the DM's Guild, and 3 on DriveThruRPG. 

There are advantages and disadvantages to each platform. But for me, the DM's Guild has been the best. 

### Price
Obviously, **Pay What You Want** gets you more eyes and downloads. It removes the "price" barrier. Every priced product from my list has single digit units sold. Every PWYW has 100+ units sold. That's pretty revealing. As a small creator,  it's been a great way to get my products into people's hands. 

## My Adventure
Surprisingly, my adventure *Doom on Starspell Mountain* has made the most money. It's worth noting that it's also been published the longest by about a month or two. But it makes me happy that even 19 people decided to pay when they didn't have to. 

Did the adventure turn a profit? Not even close. But that was never the goal. If it was, I wouldn't have spent over $250 on amazing, original artwork. But I want to surface that to set real expectations among young or smaller creators.

I hope you found something useful or at least interesting here. I don't mind being transparent about this stuff. Especially if it can help you.
