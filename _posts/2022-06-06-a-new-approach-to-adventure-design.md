Dungeons & Dragons adventures come in a variety of design styles. The hobby shows a clear progression from "modules" in the early days to more modern "adventures" published for 5E today. But even within each edition, you can find a variety of approaches, especially editions with an open gaming license.

There's no doubt that adventures written today are more "user-friendly" than in decades past. They're more accessible and employ better design practices. Adventures need to be functional (written in a way that's easy to understand and run). But they also need to be fun to read. Big publishers aim to strike a good balance here.

But I'll be honest, I can't read them. There's so much text to explain a setting, scenario, and story and I don't have the time or patience. So I've been toying with design methods for adventure writing that aim to strip out the excess.

My first attempt was [Tower of the Barrow Witch](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/391576/Tower-of-the-Barrow-Witch). It wasn't perfect but it was a great step in the right direction. Then I read [Halls of the Blood King](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/348880/Halls-of-the-Blood-King). The presentation was the next step I was looking forâ€”light, evocative, and accessible. I took that and brought it back to 5E.

A Coastal Encounter is my first attempt at building a light, evocative, and accessible scenario. It gives game masters enough to run a fun scenario but leaves room for them to bring it to life with their unique style.

This encounter is part of a wider adventure I'll be releasing. But I'd really like to know if this is a style and design you like or want to see more of. I'd appreciate it if you'd email me or Tweet me your thoughts after taking a look (or even running it).

Until then, enjoy a [free encounter](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1a1jz-0IOJmY_IZQYV23XKjYgf60YN_aL?usp=sharing) (VTT maps included)!
