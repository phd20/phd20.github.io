Have you ever wanted to share something from your Obsidian vault with your players? Are you already using Discord for chatting? Now you can. Introducing Discord Share: a plugin for sharing vault contents to Discord.

[![phd20/obsidian-discord-share - GitHub](https://gh-card.dev/repos/phd20/obsidian-discord-share.svg)](https://github.com/phd20/obsidian-discord-share)

## Getting Started

You can find the plugin at the above bookmark or at this [link](https://github.com/phd20/obsidian-discord-share). You can add this plugin to your Obsidian vault in one of two ways. 

### Manually
Copy over `main.js`, `styles.css`, `manifest.json` to your vault `VaultFolder/.obsidian/plugins/obsidian-discord-share/`.

### BRAT (Recommended)

Install the [BRAT](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat) plugin. Follow these [instructions](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat#adding-a-beta-plugin) for adding a beta plugin.

After adding the plugin, enable it. Get a Webhook URL from Discord. See [this guide](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks) for more on how to do that. Paste your Discord Webhook URL into the `Discord Webhook URL` setting for this plugin. **You must do this or the plugin will not work**.

See the [README](https://github.com/phd20/obsidian-discord-share#optional-settings) for more on the other settings.

### Share Attachment to Discord

Open the command palette and search for **Share Attachment to Discord**. Click on it or press `return` on your keyboard. This opens a modal to search your local image files. Search for the file you want and click on it or press `return` on your keyboard.

### Share Note Title to Discord
Open the command palette and search for **Share Note Title** to Discord. Click on it or press `return` on your keyboard. **This option will not show in the menu if you don't have a note open.**

## Future
I've got a lot of ideas on how to extend this to sharing more content. Some of it should be live very soon üòâ. But I'd love to hear yours. [Open an Issue](https://github.com/phd20/obsidian-discord-share/issues/new) to request features or report bugs.
