    Hi! My name is Kirk and I'm a huge fan of <strong>Dungeons & Dragons</strong>. I've been playing and DMing since 2010. 
    As a Dungeon Master, I've run hundreds of sessions and my longest campaign was 7 years. 
    I entered the hobby during D&D 4th Edition and currently play and DM 5th Edition. 
    My experience with other RPGs includes <a href="https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/star-wars-force-and-destiny/" target="_blank">Star Wars: Force and Destiny</a>, AD&D, <a href="https://www.evilhat.com/home/fate-core/" target="_blank">Fate Core</a>, <a href="https://paizo.com/pathfinder" target="_blank">Pathfinder</a>, and <a href="https://greenronin.com/sifrp/" target="_blank">A Song of Ice and Fire RPG</a>.

      I'm landlocked in Nebraska in the United States. I enjoy it here but hope to see far more of the world than I already have.
    </p>
    
    <p>I also have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/PhDnD">an old YouTube channel</a>, covering all things D&D.</p>
