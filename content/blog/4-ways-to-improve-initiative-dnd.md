“Roll initiative.” Two of the most exciting words in D&D. Almost always followed by two of the least exciting minutes of a game session. 

Initiative in Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition can put a real damper on the excitement of starting combat. Everyone needs to roll. Then comes the imperfect algorithm of humans sorting themselves. While far from broken, it’s certainly an inconvenience for most tables that aren’t using a virtual tabletop to handle it. Let’s look at 4 ways to improve initiative in 5E.

## Static Initiative
Use static initiative scores. Everyone’s initiative for the combat is simply 10 plus their initiative bonus. If someone has advantage on their initiative roll, add 5 to their static score. This results in less time rolling. But it will result in more ties. Let players resolve ties with each other. Depending on the tone of your game, have ties between player characters and monsters always favor either the PCs or the monsters. 

## Side Initiative 
Side initiative means everyone on one “side” of the combat goes first, followed by everyone on the other side. So all PCs first, then monsters. Or vice versa. Have one die rolled for each side and the higher result goes first. This reduces the rolling and simplifies the sorting. Each side can decide the order of its’ combatants. This a great method for groups that want to be a bit more tactical in combat.

## Static Side Initiative
A simple tweak to side initiative gives us static side initiative. Look at all static initiative scores for each side. The side that has the highest score goes first. Resolve a tie between sides the same way as static initiative (mentioned above). Within each side, use static scores to determine the order—with that side resolving their own ties how they see fit.

## Heroic Initiative
My favorite is what I like to call **Heroic Initiative**. It uses static side initiative but the PCs always go first with one exception—legendary creatures. This accomplishes a few things. There’s no time spent rolling. After a few sessions, the PCs know their initiative order and there’s no time spent sorting. It puts the excitement and momentum of starting combat squarely on the PCs and they can **act immediately**. They can roll *into* initiative rather than roll *for* initiative. When players come up against a legendary creature, that momentum shifts. Suddenly, they’ve lost that usual momentum—appropriate for feeling the weight of a legendary creature.

I hope these options open your eyes to how you can overcome the problems initiative introduces. I like these because they use characters’ scores without introducing a whole new system to the game. Try them out or let them inspire your own.

Game on.
