*This was from a rejected pitch to a TTRPG zine. I liked the idea too much to let it go. I've fleshed it out with all twelve locations and flavorful aspects. Enjoy!*

The **Scattered Series of the Infinite Wizard** is a series of twelve magical books scattered throughout the world. Written centuries ago by one calling himself the Infinite Wizard, each details a different area of his mansion while also allowing direct teleportation to and from it. The magical mansion is hidden in a pocket dimension and only accessible through these volumes.

If you stumbled across *Scattered Series of the Infinite Wizard Volume III*, you'd gain access to an area of the mansion that he calls the *Dragon Observatory*. Unfortunately, it wouldn't lead anywhere else unless you acquired more volumes. If you acquired Volume IV, you'd be able to move from this observatory to the *Laboratory of Chaotic Oozes*.

Each room is a fantastic location unto itself while the collected volumes begin to build the larger fantastic location they belong to. It's rumored that a complete collection of the **Scattered Series of the Infinite Wizard** unlocks far more than just all twelve locations detailed withinâ€”possibly the Infinite Wizard himself.

## Collected Works
