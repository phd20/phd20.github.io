Let's take a quick look back at the best of PhD20 in 2023.

## Organizing Obsidian for D&D
This series helps game masters simplify and secure their approach to organizing D&D with Obsidian.

- [Organizing Obsidian for D&D | The Big Picture on Vaults](/blog/organizing-obsidian-dnd-big-picture-vaults)
- [Organizing Obsidian for D&D | 3 Principles](/blog/organizing-obsidian-dnd-principles)
- [Organizing Obsidian for D&D | The Problem With Plugins](/blog/organizing-obsidian-dnd-problem-with-plugins)
- [Organizing Obsidian for D&D | Tags and Properties](/blog/organizing-obsidian-dnd-tags-properties)
- [Organizing Obsidian for D&D | SRD & External Resources](/blog/organizing-obsidian-dnd-srd-external-resources)

## Running Games 
- I started running a 5E game set in the Nentir Vale and [tried to convince you to do the same](/blog/nentir-vale-your-next-dnd-game). 
- For those hesitant to use a published setting, we talked about [3 myths](/blog/published-settings-3-myths/) to avoid. 
- For 5E, we looked at [4 ways to improve initiative](/blog/4-ways-to-improve-initiative-dnd).
- We looked at how to [chronicle RPG adventures with Discord Embeds]([Chronicle RPG Adventures with Discord Embeds](/blog/chronicle-rpgs-with-discord-embeds).
- We talked about the [Dark Side of D&D Beyond](/blog/dark-side-dnd-beyond).

## Shadowdark 
I tried out Shadowdark and loved it.
- We learned how to [Run Great Gauntlets in Shadowdark RPG](/blog/running-great-gauntlets-shadowdark-rpg).
- I even designed an [adventure](/blog/the-dark-contracts-shadowdark-adventure/) you can grab for free.

See you in 2024. 

Game on.
