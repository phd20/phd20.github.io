In a game where the game master only presents plot, much of the value of our hobby is lost. The opportunities for players to uncover the likes of forgotten truths, secret trysts, or mysterious locales *beyond* the scope of the plot(s) are what bring the game to life.

A fully realized and developed world is the apex of making player choice **matter**. But few of us, if any, have the time or energy to achieve this. Instead, focus on opportunities for your players to get lost beyond the plot in your world and you’ll reap a lot of the benefits of a fully realized one without the cost of building it. If the plot is the path, place interesting hooks just off to the side.

- *On the way to meet the Grand Duke (the plot), you come across a former priest down on her luck. Pursuing her plight does nothing to further the plot but does reveal the Machiavellian atmosphere among the local temples.*
- *While investigating the murder (the plot), you come across a love letter that the victim can no longer send. Delivering it does nothing to solve the murder but creates a bond with an NPC that may now become an ally.*
- *While trying to stop the cult from summoning a demon, you come across a cultist that wants to run away and become a street magician. Helping him escape does nothing to stop the cult but might create an ally that will return the favor someday.*

In each example, the players didn’t need to venture far from the main plot to reveal more of the world, making it feel alive. These opportunities are like doors—they can be opened [or ignored](/blog/make-lore-optional/). The important thing is to offer them. 

The easiest way to achieve this is to offer multiple choices for the players to consider. 

- *In the room, you find the amulet (the plot), a bill of sale for the local tavern, and a bottle of wine with a label that says, “Don’t Open! Belongs to Trill.”*
- *In the bustling tavern, you see two ogres rolling large dice, a cloaked man by himself in the corner (the plot), and a gnome that’s passed out with people drawing on her face.*
- *The ruined temple stands before you (the plot). Off to the right, the still burning remains of what appears to have been a tavern. Off to the left, a windmill creaks slowly around.*

You don’t need to prepare a lot for each opportunity—a sentence is enough to inspire something interesting.

When we offer choices beyond the main plot, we give a sense of realness to the world. Players begin to feel that their choices matter. These choices don’t need elaborate lore or detailed preparation. They only need something interesting that brings the world to life. Go beyond the plot.

Game on.
