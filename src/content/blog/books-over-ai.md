When you reach for AI[^1] instead of a book, you lose the serendipity that’s fueled generations of creativity. A good prompt might return some details about an interesting devil and even a (probably broken) stat block. But you won’t happen to notice the much more interesting devil on the adjacent page. A good prompt might return you the name of the city in the Forgotten Realms that you were looking for (double-check it for accuracy). But you won’t be inspired by the legendary artwork that would accompany it in a book.

The beauty of a book is that you often stumble upon something you weren’t looking for. While looking up the **Slow Natural Healing** variant in the _Dungeon Master’s Guide_, you might stumble upon the **Gritty Realism** rest variant. Check out the **Supernatural Regions** in _Tasha’s Cauldron of Everything_, and you might stumble upon the entire section on **Magical Phenomena**. Books of monsters provide near endless opportunities for serendipitous finds.

While AI might provide a bit of convenience today and more value in the future, it will never manifest the magic and serendipity of a good book in your hands. Spend some time between the pages and be inspired.

Game on.
