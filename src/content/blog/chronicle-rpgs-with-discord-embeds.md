Discord’s built-in **embeds** are a great way to chronicle your RPG adventures. Give weight to the moments that matter and impress your players with a better experience.

Embeds are a stylized way to post content to a Discord channel. They can include titles, links, text, key-value pairs, images, and more. These really help to separate casual conversation from important chronicled game events. To go a step further, post them to a channel that no one else can send messages to—a read-only channel. This creates a place where it’s easy to look back across previous posts.

## How to Post Embeds
For you Obsidian users, check out my [Obsidian Discord Share](/blog/introducing-discord-share-for-obsidian/) plugin. One of the commands allows you to send embeds using a note’s frontmatter. This method allows you to also keep a local record of each embed sent without having to look through Discord.

Not an Obsidian user? No problem. Just head on over to [Discohook](https://discohook.org/). Here, you’ll be able to get a nice preview of what the embed should look like once it’s posted.

## Ideas
You can use embeds for anything. But here are a few valuable examples.
- **Mechanical events.** For example, narrate a short or long rest and link to the rules for each as a reminder. Toss in an evocative image to set the scene.
- **Session recaps.** Skip the in-person recap and post a well-crafted one ahead of time.
- **Session summaries.** Create detailed adventure logs after each session to capture what happened.
- **In-world events.** Call out significant celestial events, festivals, reminders, etc.
- **Handouts.** Letters, bulletin boards, old books, etc. 
- **Downtime activities.** Narrate the results of downtime.
- **Journey sequences.** Narrate the results of a long journey.
- **Level-up!** Surprise the party with a notification that they’ve leveled up.

Embeds are a great way to add value without a lot of extra work. Experiment with them and see what your group likes. 

Game on.
