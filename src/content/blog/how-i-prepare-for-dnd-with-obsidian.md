When it's time to plan my next Dungeons & Dragons session, I fire up [Obsidian](/blog/getting-started-with-obsidian-dnd). But then what? Here's a behind-the-screen look at how I prepare for D&D using Obsidian and the steps from SlyFlourish's *Return of the Lazy Dungeon Master*.

# Prep

## Recap

Writing a short, snappy recap of the previous session is vital for transitioning into a gaming mindset for the entire table. Here's your chance to clarify what might be murky for players and emphasize important bits. I keep it short (3-5 sentences at most) and entertaining. If you're familiar with "Last time on Dragonball Z!" then you've got an idea of what I'm going for here.

## Steps of the Lazy DM

The rest of my prep is mostly centered around the eight steps from the *Return of the Lazy Dungeon Master*. I'll be focusing on how I use Obsidian *with* the steps but if you're interested the steps themselves, check out [SlyFlourish](https://www.slyflourish.com) for more.

## Hidden Reminders

Each step is configured to include a reminders and advice for that step. I have them as a linked previews from another note so as not to duplicate the same content for every single session. I also keep them as Obsidian comments so that I can see them when editing a file but in Reading Mode, which I use during the game, the notes aren't bogged down by them. Thanks to the Lazy GM's Resource Document, you can grab an example vault [here](https://github.com/phd20/obsidian-ttrpg-vault) if you're interested in the format.

## Links

One of Obsidian's most powerful features is its linking ability. Throughout my preparation, I link to other existing articles whenever possible. For NPCs or locations, I link to their individual notes.

For Magic Items, I like to preview relevant information about them. So I use linked previews. Import the [D&D 5E SRD REmastered](https://github.com/OldManUmby/DND.SRD.Wiki) into your vault to make this easier. But remember to [organize for external resources](/blog/organizing-obsidian-dnd-srd-external-resources).

# Notes

I leave a blank section for notes during a session. I try to keep these to short bullet points.

# Review

I have a section at the bottom of my notes that I come back to after a session. 

## Summary

The summary is just a quick recap of what actually happened in that session. Again, I focus on short bullet points. 

## Retrospective

The retrospective is for notes on what went well, what could have gone better, and what I can do about it for future sessions. This session proves *really* valuable and ensures that I'm always striving for small improvements to our games.

Hopefully this quick, behind-the-screen look at my prep note structure gives you ideas or inspiration. You can easily reuse this Obsidian format for any framework. Use whatever works for you.

Game on.
