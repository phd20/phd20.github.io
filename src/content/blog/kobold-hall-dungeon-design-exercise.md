Designing dungeons is one of the many fun jobs of a game master. But designing a dungeon from scratch can be daunting *and* time-consuming. In this article, we’ll start with a simple map and your only job is to make it better. By the end, you’ll have a nice little dungeon to toss into your game or show off on social media. 

## The Dungeon
**Kobold Hall** is a dungeon from the *Dungeon Master’s Guide* for *4th Edition Dungeons & Dragons*. It’s simple and linear, tracking with how most 4E adventures (especially early ones) were written. It’s not a bad dungeon but it falls a bit short if you’re playing 5E. Luckily, Kobold Hall just needs a few small tweaks to become a _great_ dungeon. That’s where you come in!

## The Design
One idea for creating awesome dungeons is to use “Xandering” design. For an in-depth look at what that is, check out [this series](https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/13085/roleplaying-games/xandering-the-dungeon) by the Alexandrian. There’s also [A Simpler Checklist for Engaging Dungeon Maps](https://slyflourish.com/simpler_jaquay_style_maps.html). To keep the exercise simple, I chose to focus on **secret paths** that introduce new areas and create new ways to navigate Kobold Hall—skipping rooms or introducing new dynamics to existing rooms. 

## The Exercise
1. Get a copy of the Kobold Hall map. You can perform a Google image search or get a screenshot from the [4E DMG](https://www.dmsguild.com/product/56694/Dungeon-Masters-Guide-4e). 
2. Recreate the map in your tool of choice: a digital map-maker like Inkarnate or DungeonScrawl, graph paper, or simply nodes (circles) and paths (lines) on a blank piece of paper.
3. Add a secret pathway between two existing rooms.
4. Add another secret pathway between existing rooms. In this one, include something interesting like a secret room or treasure—something fun to discover!
5. Add an alternate route between two existing rooms to create a decision point for players.

By now, you should have a pretty interesting dungeon and one **you** helped design. From here, you can continue to add details to the dungeon as-is or keep adding interesting paths and new rooms.  

## What I Came Up With
Here’s what I came up with. I added a secret path behind a shrine that leads to the final room. I also added a secret path and hidden shrine that leads to a ledge in the final room—adding a dynamic element to the boss fight environment. Lastly, I added a simple alternate route between two rooms.

I hope this simple exercise showed you how easy it can be to upgrade an existing dungeon and add your own creative spark. 

Game on.
