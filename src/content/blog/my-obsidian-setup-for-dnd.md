*Originally posted on 2022-10-30*

It's easy to [get started](/blog/getting-started-with-obsidian-dnd/) with Obsidian but the organizational possibilities are endless. Let's take a look "behind the screen" at my setup for Dungeons & Dragons. This is how I organize my world and campaigns within Obsidian. 

## One Vault to rule them all...

I started with two vaults: one for D&D and one for everything else (this blog, home projects, work, etc). My "everything else" has since moved to Notion. I find it better for that sort of stuff. As of today, my Obsidian vault is entirely used for D&D. For more on this topic, consider the [big picture on vaults](/blog/organizing-obsidian-dnd-big-picture-vaults/).

### Why One Vault for D&D

You can make the argument for using a vault for each campaign or world. But I have a number of "shared" notes that I would be referencing in each (rules references, setting details, etc). That's not easy to do with Obsidian without duplicating notes (something I try to avoid). So I lean into a single vault and organize it to meet my needs.

## Dungeons & Dragons "Behind the Screen" Organization

Here's my main folder structure. Let's break it down.

```
main-vault
└───Atlas
└───Campaigns
└───Characters
└───Gamemaster Tools
└───Items
└───Lore
└───Organizations
└───Ω assets
└───Ω external
└───Ω utility
```

### Atlas

*The gazetteer for setting information.*

I start with notes for my *universal regions*. Think "planes of existence." For my universe, those are **the Known World** (the material plane and majority of the setting notes), **Elder World**, **Dark World**, **Astral Dominion**, and **Elemental Chaos**. Within **the Known World**, I separate out *world regions* into folders. These are individual settings within the world (usually a continent or focused area). I use folders because I have a lot more notes for various kingdoms than I do for the **Elemental Chaos**. 

```
main-vault
  └───Atlas
        └───The Known World
            └───Aer 
            └───Algoria
            └───Dragonmir
            └───Eldramir
            └───Kandalur
            └───Nentir Vale 
            └───The Fold 
            └───Xanthomir
        │   Astral Dominion.md 
        │   Dark World.md
        │   Elder World.md
        │   Elemental Chaos.md
└───Campaigns
└───Characters
└───Gamemaster Tools
└───Items
└───Lore
└───Organizations
└───Ω assets
└───Ω external
└───Ω utility
```

### Campaigns

*Campaign-specific notes for planning and logging.*

To start, I have a folder for each campaign. Within each, I use folders for **player characters**, **[session notes](/blog/how-i-prepare-for-dnd-with-obsidian)**, and anything else I need to organize for that specific campaign. If a campaign isn't part of my overall setting, then I'll keep setting details within the campaign's folder instead of the Atlas.

### Characters

*A comprehensive list of NPCs across campaigns.* 

### Gamemaster Tools

*Tools to make my DM life easier.*

- Random tables (for NPCs, locations, wild magic, and other stuff)
- Adventure building binder (design advice)
- Homebrew rules
- DM Screen

### Items

*Magical and non-magical items of interest.*

Magic items and mundane items like books. I lean heavily into [optional lore](/blog/make-lore-optional/) via books and scrolls.

### Lore

*Universal truths and systems that reach across settings.*

This folder contains information on large-scale events, myths and legends, calendar, cosmology, magic, and the divine pantheon.

### Organizations

*A complete list of organizations from across my setting and campaigns.*

That's a quick overview of how I organize my Obsidian vault for Dungeons & Dragons.

Game on.
