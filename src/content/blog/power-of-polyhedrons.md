In RPGs, dice can transcend the players and game master as the ultimate arbiter and creator of outcomes. Without rolling dice (or insert other resolution mechanic here) in RPGs, it’s hard to say that we’re playing a game. But dice are the crucible through which our imaginary creations are given a sense of truth and meaning. When called upon, dice deliver an answer that’s beyond our imaginations. They assist both players and game masters in suspending their disbelief by providing some outside authority that governs outcomes in our fantasy worlds. The unpredictability of a die roll adds tension and excitement.

Dice can even help in our hobby beyond just resolving situations during a game. We can use dice in worldbuilding and game preparation. They help us overcome a blank page, perfectionism, creative blocks, and indecision. Random tables are at the heart of this.

But if we’re going to roll the dice *in game*, we need to **trust** the dice. Either the dice results matter or they don’t. The latter is a travesty. But wait, aren’t we just making stuff up anyways? Why does it matter if there’s game master fiat involved? Honestly, it doesn’t matter as there will always be *some* amount of it. But in those cases, why roll dice if we need to dictate the outcome? 

When a game master rolls the dice but ignores the outcome, at least two major issues arise. The first, is that the role the dice play is now confused. This technique is usually used to buy time because the game master hasn’t thought through what comes next yet and calling for a die roll is an easy way to get players involved. The second, is that it minimizes the potential for the dice. A good die roll has people on the edge of their seats. It’s more than just standard operating procedure.

The best die rolls are called for when a game master knows the results for and outcomes that arise from success, failure, and anything between. This is hard to do and often we won’t achieve it. But [aiming for it](/blog/the-elusive-game/) is noble. When we do achieve this, it’s magic. Here are a few tips for elevating the dice:

- **Reveal the target number and consequences for failure ahead of the roll.** This adds to the tension.
- **Success *and* failure should always move the story forward in an interesting way.** Avoid situations where “nothing happens” after a roll.
- **Roll dice in the open.** This will help everyone suspend their disbelief and immerse in the game.

When we embrace the power of the polyhedrons, our games can be transformed. Roll often. Roll with purpose. Let the dice fall where they may. 

Game on.
