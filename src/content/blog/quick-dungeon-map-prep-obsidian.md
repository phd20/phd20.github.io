*Updated 2023-08-14*

In this article, we'll look at how to quickly prep a published dungeon in Obsidian. By the end, you'll have a visual of your map along with notes for keyed locations. Let's roll.

*The map and adventure seen in the screenshots of this article are from Trial of the Slime Lord by Jordan Rudd and Winter's Daughter by Gavin Norman.*

## Set Up the Plugin
If you haven't already, follow the [basic map](/blog/creating-a-basic-interactive-map-in-obsidian/) guide to install and enable the Leaflet plugin. You can skip the optimizations and the rest of that guide.

## Create the Map
Add the image file of the map to your vault. Use [this code block](https://gist.github.com/phd20/f6ec5674b5442f0bb77de2d135043bb4) in a new note to create the map. Adjust the `id` and `image` parameters to reflect your map image. Tinker with any of the other parameters as you see fit.

### Key the Map
Right-click on the rendered map to add markers for each room or keyed location in your dungeon.

## Link Your Notes
Now for the âœ¨ *magic*. If you're prepping from a digital source, simply grab screenshots for each keyed location in the adventure. Add them to your vault. If you're prepping with a physical book, take a picture of each keyed location and add them to your vault. 

![A popup menu showing options including Edit Marker](/images/obsidian-dungeon-edit-marker.png)

Right-click on a marker and click `Edit Marker`. Edit the `Note to Open` to link to the associated image. Don't forget to add the image's file extension (the plugin will leave it out).

Under `Edit Marker` > `Show Advanced Options`, make sure that `Display Tooltip` is set to `Hover`. This will let you see previews of each location by just hovering over the map marker.

### Bonus: Link PDF Pages
Take it a step further by linking directly to the PDFs (and specific pages!) right within your vault. For the `Note to Open` field, choose the PDF, add the file extension, and use the following syntax to link to a specific page: `#page=`.

So if they keyed location on your map is described on page 19 of your adventure's PDF, your `Note to Open` would look like: `adventure.pdf#page=19`.

That's it! Now you've got a quick and dirty dungeon map with all of your notes tied to the keyed locations. 

Game on.
