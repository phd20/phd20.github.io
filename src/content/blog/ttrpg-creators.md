Here's a non-comprehensive list of TTRPG creators that I've found inspiring and/or valuable over the last decade.

- [Questing Beast](https://www.youtube.com/@QuestingBeast). Ben has an excellent **newsletter** and videos focusing mostly (but not all) on "old-school games." He's also a game designer and one of the best communicators of the **OSR**.
- [Runehammer Games](https://www.runehammer.online). A **truly brilliant game designer** and artist. Brandish creates beloved games, writes thoughtfully about our hobby, and makes fun and valuable videos. 
- [Alphastream](https://alphastream.org). Teos is a well-known designer within the TTRPG industry. His blogs are **well-researched and informative**. He's got the rare ability to think practically from both the designer and hobbyist angles on most topics and I appreciate that.
- [SlyFlourish](https://slyflourish.com). I've gotten more value from following Mike the last 10+ years than probably anyone else on this list. His advice for GMs is **invaluable and simple**. His blog, videos, and products are all worth your time and coin.
- [The Alexandrian](https://thealexandrian.net). Thoughtful blog posts on running games of all kinds. 
- [Dungeon Craft](https://www.youtube.com/@DUNGEONCRAFT1). Entertaining videos about the industry, independent games, and tips for running better D&D.
- [Bob World Builder](https://www.youtube.com/@BobWorldBuilder). **Fun** videos on everything about our hobby. Highly recommend.
- [Matthew Colville](https://www.youtube.com/@mcolville). Some of the **best advice** you can find on running D&D games presented in a fun and engaging way.
- [the DM Lair](https://www.youtube.com/@theDMLair). Funny advice videos and enjoyable Dungeon Master Q&As.
- [Dungeon Masterpiece](https://www.youtube.com/@DungeonMasterpiece). Excellent videos on running games, the industry at large, and geopolitics in worldbuilding.

- [RPG with DBJ](https://www.youtube.com/@RPGwithDBJ). A **hidden gem** of fun streams covering the hobby and worldbuilding from the angle of weekly "themes."
- [Mastering Dungeons](https://www.youtube.com/@masteringdungeons). A **must-listen podcast** by two veteran game designers that answers listener questions, covers industry news, and dives deep into various products and topics.
