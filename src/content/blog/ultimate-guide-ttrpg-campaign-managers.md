I'm fascinated by the opportunities that technology unlocks for tabletop roleplaying game campaign management. Nearly a decade ago, I kickstarted one of the best choices out there. But by 2016, few options (if any) were keeping up with technology. IÂ [ranted](https://youtu.be/ZNcQnjpLVuk)Â about itâ€”[twice](https://youtu.be/maUxXZnyws4). Since those rants, this micro-industry has taken off. Now we have an overwhelming number of options. Some options are built for TTRPGs. Some are not. So where do we start? Let's dive into the **features**, **strengths**, and **weaknesses** of the *best* options available. 

## TTRPG Software

### World Anvil 

![A look at the World Anvil dashboard](/images/world-anvil-overview.png)

> Write Articles to Detail and Keep Track of Everything in YourÂ _World_. Create YourÂ _World_. Manage Your Campaign. Plan Your Novel. Be a Hero. Worldbuilding Prompts. Master Your Campaign. MakeÂ _Worlds_Â Interactive. Wow your players. Be the best Gamemaster.

World Anvil is aÂ _gargantuan_Â suite of tools for building worlds, managing RPG campaigns, and writing novels. You organize your content in wiki-like articles. Even better than their amazing product is the community around it. The passionate founders interact with the massive community through annual contests, weekly streams, and a bustling Discord server. No other programs out there come with more features out of the box. Iâ€™d even argue that no other program offers as rich of a way toÂ _present_Â your world to an audience.

#### Key Features 
- Organization with tags and categories 
- Presentation using pre-made themes or custom styling 
- Templates and worldbuilding prompts to drive creativity 
- Permission tools to limit who can see specific content 
- Mapping tools to add pins and layers tied to content 
- Various ways to link content together 

#### Strengths  

- **Presentation**. You have plenty of tools at your disposal for complete control over how your information is shared and presented.
- **Community**. World Anvil boasts an amazing community. Explore other worlds, view in-depth guides, or become inspired by daily worldbuilding prompts. Participate in community events and writing challenges. 
- **Monetization**. World Anvil's Sage tier provides excellent tooling for monetizing your content.

#### Weaknesses

- **Overwhelming UI/UX**. A bit of feature bloat leads toÂ _so_Â much going on for nearly every interface. Dozens, if not hundreds of buttons and options. 
- **Moderate Learning Curve**. Though the guides are great, thereâ€™s a moderate learning curve to find the best workflows in World Anvil. Some pages loadÂ _very_ slowly while other interfaces are quicker. Finding the right way to work can take some time.

#### Cost 

World Anvil has a free tier to let you play with common features. Three paid tiers offer monthly and yearly subscriptions or a one-time "Lifetime Membership" payment. These tiers range from tools for novice writers to professionals looking to monetize content. At the time of writing, monthly paid memberships start as low as $7.

### LegendKeeper

![A look at the Legendkeeper UI showing a map with pins.](/images/legendkeeper-overview.png)

> _LegendKeeper_Â is a modern web app that makes it easy to design, build, and share worlds for any kind of story.

LegendKeeper is a fast and flexible tools for worldbuilding and TTRPG campaign management. The tool is surrounded by a passionate founder and active community. The use of modern technologies under the hood make this appÂ _fast_Â to use. Iâ€™d argue that no other program offers workflows this fast and easy to use.

#### Key Features 
- Simple and powerful editor with the `/` menu
- Intuitive mapping tools to drop pins and link to wiki content 
- Linking through quick mentions or auto-linking for entire documents 
- Built-in offline support 
- Granular permissions to limit who can see content 

#### Strengths  

- **Easy to use**. LegendKeeper has almost no learning curve. Just open a document and start typing. The tools are easy to understand and feel familiar. Drag and drop to organize your wiki.
- **Fast**. LegendKeeper outperforms the TTRPG competitors when it comes to loading times and workflow speed. Iâ€™d attribute this to the founder embracing modern technologies and making performance a priority.
- **Flexible**. Youâ€™re in control of what documents contain and what templates you decide to create. Youâ€™re in control of how the wiki is organized.

#### Weaknesses 

-   **Public access**. Thereâ€™s no public access. For someone to see your stuff, youâ€™d need to invite them to give them access. They need to set up and account and all that jazz. *Luckily*, public access is touted in their next major release.
-   **Presentation**. You can create columns, headings, tables, etc. But you canâ€™t add custom styling like CSS or custom fonts. Youâ€™re left with the interface presented to you at the beginning.

#### Cost 

LegendKeeper has a free 14-day trial to let you try it out. After that, it's either $9/month or $90/year.

## Non-TTRPG Software 

### Obsidian 

![An overview of the Obsidian UI showing a map with pins, dice roller, and other features.](/images/obsidian-overview-23.png)

> A second brain, for you, forever. Obsidian is a powerful and extensible knowledge base that works on top of your local folder of plain text files. 

Obsidian is aÂ **powerhouse**Â for organizing notes. If you forced me to pick one option from this article, Obsidian wins by a mile. This knowledge base works from local files and features are extended by community-built plugins. There's a strong TTRPG presence in the community and a handful of plugins designed for our hobby.

#### Key Features 
- Community plugins 
- Customizable workspace (appearance and features)
- Powerful linking system 
- You own and control your data 
- Active community 

#### Strengths  
- **Performance**. The app runs off of your local files so it's *lightning* fast.
- **Own your data**. "Your notes live on your device, period. You can encrypt them or back them up however you want; it's your decision, not ours." 
- **Infinitely extensible**. The community plugins are a gamechanger. Anyone can design and share features to extend Obsidian.

#### Weaknesses 
- **Sharing**. Outside of the paid Publish feature, there aren't great ways to share your content. Luckily for TTRPGs, you can use my [Discord Share](/blog/2022-11-07-introducing-discord-share-for-obsidian) plugin to share things with your players ðŸ˜‰.
- **Scaled learning curve**. The basics of organizing and writing notes couldnâ€™t be simpler. But with the more advanced features, you will need to read documentation or watch tutorials. For example, some of the plugins provideÂ *really powerful*Â capabilities. But you wonâ€™t figure out how to use them without a little reading. I've got an article to help you [get started](/blog/getting-started-with-obsidian-dnd/).

#### Cost 
Obsidian is free. You can add Sync (backup to access across devices) for $10/month or $96/year. Publish to a public website for $20/month or $192/year. Neither of these is required and free alternatives exist. 

### Notion 

![Overview of Notion UI showing cards with images](/images/notion-overview.png)

> Too many tools? Too much chaos? WithÂ _Notion_, all your work is in one place. Get started for free. Better shared docs. Hassle-free wiki software. All your projects tracked. Infinite flexibility.

Notion is an awesome app to manageÂ _anything_Â and works just as well to manage a TTRPG campaign. Everything fits into a database model with slick features for sharing and presenting different views of your data. 

#### Key Features 
- Database structure with views and filtering
- Content blocks for quick editing 
- Easily publish to the web 
- User-friendly interface 

#### Strengths  
- **Easy to use**. A well-designed interface organizes features that are easy to understand. 
- **Sharing**. It's easy to publish to the web and to restrict sharing to certain members (limit 10 on the free tier).

#### Weaknesses 
- **Difficult to reorganize**. With the database structure, it can be difficult to blow things up and reorganize on the fly. Not a huge weakness but something to be aware of.
- **Presentation**. Notion looks nice but other than a banner image and icon, you can't customize the look. You're stuck with how they lay out individual notes. 

#### Cost 
You can do almost everything you need (in TTRPGs) for free. For $8/month you can invite more guests and get a 30-day page history.
