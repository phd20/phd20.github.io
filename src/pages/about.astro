    <p>
        ðŸ‘‹ My name is Kirk. I've been playing D&D since 2010. In 2011, Chris Perkins chose my dungeon design as a finalist for his 
        "Acererak's Apprentice" contest on the <em>Dungeon Master Experience</em> blog. That introduced me 
        to some other creators and led me to YouTube, where I ran a D&D channel for the next five years.

    <p>
        I'm particularly passionate about the intersection of our hobby and technologyâ€”both the good and the bad. I write a lot about 
        building campaigns and worlds and the tools to help us organize them.
